# Flamework
Flamework is a highly opinionated game framework.
It requires typescript and offers many useful features and abstractions.

It is currently in beta which prioritizes stability and bug fixes over new additions.

## Documentation
In-depth documentation, and installation steps, are hosted on my website.
